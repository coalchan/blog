这首由詹妮弗·劳伦斯亲自唱的民谣（The Hanging Tree），在电影院里看的时候，配合着反抗的主题，让人在感到一丝悲凉的同时，激起心中无限的力量与他（她）为了反抗的对象，愿意一起赴死对抗到底。<!--more-->

曲罢，心中的万丈激情渐渐褪去，更加感到悲凉的是代入集体反抗的同时我丢失了自己，要想找回就要重新回归大众，这是一条无归之路。Katniss在我看来却一直保持着自己与大众的距离，不知接下来的命运如何。

> Coming to the tree
> They strung up a man
> They say who murdered three
> Strange things did happen here
> No stranger would it be
> If we met at midnight
> In the hanging tree

> Are you, are you
> Coming to the tree
> Where dead man called out
> For his love to flee
